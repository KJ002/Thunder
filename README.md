**Thunder** is a basic 2D physics engine. It uses the idea of PhysicsBodies being contained and updated by a PhysicsEnvironment. Thunder is only designed to be used in basic 2D games as it does not have any capacity for collision response.

I do not intend for Thunder to gain any traction nor be implemented in any games, it is mearly a project to work on and learn about physics engines.
